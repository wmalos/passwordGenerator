# passwordGenerator

For this task I was asked to complete a password generator. I was given much of the html and had to make sure it would function by adding the JavaScript.

Steps:

Added the check boxes in the html that were needed for the variables
Made sure the JavaScript was linking properly
Started JS by creating the the functions for randomly pulling different characters
Make it so the different variable functions are also being pulled randomly
Add event listener so that the browser responds on the click of the generate button
Ensure that the generator is responding to the boxes being checked and unchecked
